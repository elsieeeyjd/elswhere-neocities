          <h1 class='specialtextL'>why am i making a website?</h1> <!--In general, this content is automatically generated for blog posts-->
          <p class="maintext"><b>09/06/2025</b></p>
          <p class='maintext'>A lot of people gravitate towards neocities because of the so-called 'lack of humanity' on social media these days(and also because of AI). Webmasters that I've came across on reddit, pinterest, and neocities alike all seem to yearn for a 'simpler time' of the internet. That might also be why many webmasters opted for a dated aesthetic on their website, mimicing the y2k charm. After all, neocities is supposed to be the successor of geocities, a web-hosting service mostly active in the 2000s, which called each website its users make as 'cities' on the internet, hence its name.</p>
          <p class='maintext'>To be honest, I wouldn't know what the 'old internet' looks like. I was only two when geocities shut down (2007-er okay? don't judge), and thanks to my parents, I was never really 'online' until I was around 11 or 12, which, by then, social media apps have already became the new norm.</p>
          <p class='maintext'>So why, you might ask, am I making a website with zero web development experience, naming it 'my corner of the internet', and dabble with y2k styling if I was never there when these stuff were at their prime?</p> 
          <p class='maintext'>Partially, I think GenZ's fondness towards the 'vintage' or 'y2k aesthetic' despite not having experienced it does play a factor. However, I'll explore this in a seperate blog post. For now, Ima keep to my own lane.</p>
          <p class='maintext'>So, no, I hadn't experienced this so-called 'old internet' that many neocities users are trying to mimic. I'm even certain that social media is the first thing I came in contact with when I first started going online. Even now, I'm a chronically online potato who doomscrolls when she got no better things to do.</p>
          <p class='maintext'>Why am I trying to make a website, then? Well, it's mostly because i was bored one night and decided to dive down a rabbit hole after thinking that it'd be cool to have my own website and then proceed to find out that all existing "no code" website builders are either too professional-looking or kinda suck. I want my website to be my own corner, like a digital closet in a sense. That's why I eventually chose neocities.</p>
          <p class="maintext">I also want a little space to showcase my own work, be it artworks or projects, on my own terms. I also put 'learning another skill' on my 2025 bingo card. So, hey, three birds with one stone? Thanks to whoever made that comment on pinterest that namedropped neocities onto my radar.</p>
          <p class="maintext">To be completely frank, I'm quite spontaneous when embarking on projects like these. So it's totally possible that I go on a long hiatus once school starts in september (especially since I will be moving abroad for uni). But hey, I started this website back in early May, and I'd still happily work on the code everyday (albeit with crashouts). And if I do take a hiatus, that's another reason why I like neocities: I don't need to feel pressured to push out contents like other social media platforms. I just do whatever I want.</p>
          <p class="maintext">Okay, okay, this post is turning into a bit of a ramble. This *is* a test post for this blog i set up with zonolet after all. But I gues this also serves as an introduction and a tiny manifesto of my goal and expectations for this website.</p>
          <p class="maintext">Alright, bye for now, I hope you enjoy my site! :)</p>
